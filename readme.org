** stillness-mode

A global emacs minor mode that stops windows from resizing and scrolling when you complete something. Inspired by [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aA1wfW6t0g][Psionikus]].

*Installation*:

with straight.el:

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(straight-use-package '(stillness-mode :host github :repo "neeasade/stillness-mode.el" :branch "main"))
#+end_src

with [[https://git.savannah.gnu.org/cgit/emacs.git/commit/?id=2ce279680bf9c1964e98e2aa48a03d6675c386fe][vc-use-package]] (emacs 30)

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(use-package stillness
  :demand t
  :vc (:url "https://github.com/neeasade/stillness-mode.el" :branch "main"))
#+end_src

*Features*:

- works with horizontally stacked windows
- accounts for windows below the expected minibuffer height
- keep your region up if it would be visible

*Customization*

~stillness-mode~ should /just work/, but you can tell it the expected minibuffer
height by setting ~stillness-mode-minibuffer-height~

*Caveats*:

- if you depend on the point /during/ a completing read, this breaks you (eg [[https://github.com/oantolin/embark][embark]])
- ~stillness-mode~ doesn't account for line wrapping.
